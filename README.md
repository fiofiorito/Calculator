# React Calculator project

Minimalist and simple calculator using React.
It does the bare minimun, add, subtract, multiply and divide. 

## How it works
To work and not use a boring html form, the frontend has event listeners for click and touch on every button on the calculator, just press the buttons and it will return the value!

## Goal
Goal: Create the frontend of the calculator app using React and then attach that to the backend using NodeJS, idk if it possible but i assume it is.
