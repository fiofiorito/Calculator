# First iFio Full-Stack WebApp - Calculator 
I am happy to announce that I have completed my first ever full stack project using React + NodeJS!!
Update: for the goal i had in mind i only needed to use react 
It has been a journey filled with ups and downs, a lot of learning involved as well. 

## How to use
Just click the number, then your desired operator and then the equals sign to get your result displayed on the calc screen!

## My why
I decided to take on this project because 1. I wanted to build a calculator since I started coding 6 months ago and 2. I had one question in mind after finishing the full stack web dev course I took: "Can I make a full stack web app using React and NodeJS?" And sure thing, with a little bit of research I discovered I could! And that's when I said well I think its time to challenge myself with the calculator web app ðŸ˜€

## Struggles & Learnings
- Realized I needed event listeners so I had to deepen my knowledge of react hooks and the onClick property
- Struggled to "communicate" the button component with the screen component so that the data passed from the button would be displayed on the calc screen 
- Realized I needed to add a callback function inside the App component and then add that as a custom property to my 2 custom components
- Now it's time for deployment, as this is my first project with react, if you are reading this, then the app is most definitely deployed!!

Remember, nothing is impossible and if your mind can think of it, then you can probably code it ðŸ˜‰ It's just a matter of not giving up when you don't know something, just keep going, learning is always the solution!!
